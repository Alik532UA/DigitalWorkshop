// of these — the switcher renders whichever groups end up non-empty, in this
// order, so the list stays organized as more languages are added. Grouped by
// language family/branch, not strict geography (e.g. Swedish/Norwegian/
// Danish/Icelandic are North Germanic, so they live in "germanic" alongside
// English, German and Dutch, not in a separate "Nordic" bucket).
